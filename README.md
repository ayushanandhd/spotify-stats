## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spotify-stats.git
cd spotify-stats
```

2. Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

3. Set up your Spotify API credentials:

- Create a new Spotify application at the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications).
- Add your redirect URI (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify`) to the application's settings.
- Copy your Client ID and Client Secret.

4. Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your Spotify credentials:
```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/spotify
```

5. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
